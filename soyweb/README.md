# soyweb

soyweb is a Go library providing [ssg-go extensions](https://github.com/soyart/ssg).

soyweb extensions respect ssg-go quirks such as ssgignore,
handling of header and footer templates, preference of source HTML files
over the Markdown, file permissions, etc.

In addition to the library, it also confusingly
provides an executable [`cmd/soyweb`](#soyweb-main-program).

## soyweb (main program)

soyweb extends Go ssg implementation for complex static site management,
and is intended to be a better replacement for [webtools](https://github.com/soyart/artnoi.com/commit/ec01c2ec884bca8c4ca15ff5afa7db0e7b4608a6).
It could also be used to build multiple static sites at once, each with different
set of ssg options.

It uses a [*manifest*](#soyweb-manifest) file to describe how each *ssg site*
is going to be built. The manifest is like a config file or `package.json`
for our site - it defines ssg options (e.g. the source and destination directories)
as well as other soyweb options.

> See [`manifest.json`](../testdata/manifest.json) as example
>
> To try soyweb, go into `./testdata` and run soyweb

Synopsis:
```
soyweb <command> [<args>]
```

soyweb reads manifest(s) and apply changes specified in them.
Because it is a multi-stage application, soyweb exposes these stages
as 3+1 CLI *subcommand*:

- Default mode

  It builds `./manifest.json` with all stages.

  Due to the limitation of the CLI library, this default
  mode takes no arguments.

  ```shell
  # Build from ./manifest.json (default path)
  soyweb
  ```

- `soyweb build`

  This subcommands build sites from one or multiple manifests.

  We can specify skip flags to `build`, which will make soyweb
  skip some particular stages during application of manifests.

  > By default, `soyweb build` enables the soyweb index generator
  > and all minifiers are disabled.

  Help:

  ```shell
  soyweb build -h
  ```

  Examples:

  ```shell
  # Build from ./manifest.json (same with default behavior)
  soyweb build

  # Like above, but do not generate index from marker _index.soyweb
  soyweb build --no-gen-index

  # Build from ./manifest.json
  # without copying files defined in manifest
  soyweb build --no-copy

  # Build from ./m1.json and ./m2.sjon
  soyweb build ./m1.json ./m2.json

  # Build from ./m1.json and ./m2.json
  # without actually building HTMLs from Markdowns
  #
  # The --no-build option also disables all soyweb build features
  # that relies on ssg options, such as minifiers and index generator
  soyweb build --no-build ./m1.json ./m2.json

  # Build from ./m1.json and ./m2.json
  # and minify all HTML files built from Markdown
  soyweb build ./m1.json ./m2.json --min-html

  # Like above, but minify all HTML files
  soyweb build ./m1.json ./m2.json --min-html --min-html-copy

  # Like above, but minify all HTML files and CSS files
  soyweb build ./m1.json ./m2.json --min-html --min-html-copy --min-css
  ```

- `soyweb clean`

  Removes target files specified in the manifests' `copies` directive

  Help:

  ```shell
  soyweb clean -h
  soyweb cleanup -h
  ```

- `soyweb copy`

  Copy files specified in the manifests' `copies` directive

  Help:

  ```shell
  soyweb copy -h
  ```

## Other soyweb programs

> Most of these programs share the same CLI flags, and the help messages
> can be accessible via `-h` or `--help`

In addition to the bloated executable`soyweb`, soyweb (the project) also
provides minimal executables to integrate into other static site pipelines:

- [minifier](./cmd/minifier)

  A web format minifier. It minifies a single source file and writes the
  minified version to different location, or all supported files under
  the source directory

  `minifier` by default minifies all known media types, but this behavior
  can be controlled with `--no-min-{ext}` flags:

  ```shell
  # Do not minify .js files
  minifier some/src some/dst --no-min-js

  # Do not minify .html and .css files
  minifier some/src some/dst --no-min-html --no-min-css
  ```

- [ssg-minifier](./cmd/ssg-minifier)

  A minifier-enabled version of standard ssg.

## soyweb manifest

A soyweb manifest is a JSON file describing all ssg-go and soyweb options for *soyweb site*s.
It defines soyweb sites as a JSON map object, accessed via *site key*:

```json
{
  "some-site-1": {
    "src": "some-site-1/src",
    "dst": "some-site-1/dist",
    "title": "Title Site 1",
    "url": "example-1.com",
    "name": "Example Site 1",
    "option-1": false,
    "options-2": [
      "foo",
      "bar",
      "baz"
    ]
  },
  "some-site-2": {
    "src": "some-site-2/src",
    "dst": "some-site-2/dist",
    "title": "Title Site 2",
    "url": "example-2.com",
    "name": "Example Site 2",
    "option-1": true,
  }
}
```

Above is a soyweb manifest that defines 2 sites: `Example Site 1` and `Example Site 2`.
`Example Site 1` is accessed via `some-site-1` site key.

Each site object contains options for the site,
like [the soyweb index generator](#soyweb-index-generator)
and [soyweb minifiers](#soyweb-minifiers).

Real world example would be [manifest.json](../testdata/manifest.json).

A soyweb site can be thought of as the smallest unit of a website,
and how your site will be organized into soyweb sites are entirely up to you.

In reality, a soyweb site only exists so that we can apply different soyweb options
against different source roots. Multiple such sites may in reality make up 1 website.

## soyweb ssg-go options

soyweb extends ssg-go options using `ssg.Option` type.

### soyweb minifiers

soyweb provides webformat minifiers opitions for ssg, implemented as
hooks that map 1 input data to 1 output data.

The minifiers is available to all programs under soyweb.

### soyweb index generator

soyweb provides an automatic [index generator](./index.go),
implemented as a [ssg.Pipeline](../ssg-go/options.go). This pipeline
will automatically generate index sibling Markdowns, HTMLs, and directories.

The pipeline looks for marker file `_index.soyweb` somewhere under `${src}`, and,
if found, lists all links to the children (i.e. "articles").

The marker `_index.soyweb` can be empty, or contain template. If not empty, the
template inside the marker will be treated as Markdown.

To be considered an entry by the generator, the marker's sibling has to satisfy
at least one of the criteria:

- A file with `.md` or `.html` extension

  The generated index will point to HTML extensions

- A directory with `index.html` or `index.md`

  The generated index will point to HTML extensions

- A directory with another marker `_index.soyweb` (recursive)

  The generated index will point to `${sibling}/index.html`

The generator is currently available to `soyweb` via the site manifest specification.

#### Index generator: templates in markers

The generator allows markers to contain partial template.

The marker `_index.soyweb` could be a Markdown, and apart from having its content
appended by the generated index, the file is handled normally like with other
ssg-go input files.

If the marker `_index.soyweb` is empty, a default content header will be written.
If the marker has some template, then the index list will be appended to the template
in the output.

#### Index generator: how it's generated

The generated indexes are treated just like any other source Markdown files.

In other words, `_header.html` and `_footer.html` will surround the index generated from
marker files. [`ssg.TitleFrom`](../ssg-go/title.go) tags are respected and title extraction
for the generated index is handled in the familiar fashion.

#### Index generator: link title extraction (files)

Only Markdown and HTML siblings are to be linked. For example, if we have 2 files
`1.md` and `2.html`, then links will be generated for `1.html` and `2.html`.

Link titles are extracted from tag `:ssg-title` first (`:ssg-title FooTitle`),
and if there's no such title, then the generator falls back to Markdown h1 titles
(`# FooTitle`) will be picked as the child title *within* the index.

#### Index generator: link title extraction (directories)

If a marker's sibling is a directory with `index.md`, then the titles will be extracted
from the Markdown index like with files.

If there's no `index.md`, then the directory names will be used as titles. And instead
of linking to `/some/path/targetdir/index.md`, the directory links ends with a slash,
so `/some/path/targetdir/` is the hyperlink generated.

#### Index generator: practical examples

Consider a ssg source directory `src`:

```
src
│
├── _footer.html
├── _header.html
├── _index.soyweb
│
├── foo.md
├── bar.md
│
├── 2022
│   ├── _index.soyweb
│   ├── lol.md
│   └── not_article.svg
│
├── 2023
│   ├── hahaha
│   │   └── index.md
│   ├── _index.soyweb
│   └── baz.md
│
└── somedir
    └── index.md
```

We see 3 markers, in `src`, `src/2022`, and `src/2023`. This means
that we should get 3 generated `index.html`s. But we also see that
`src/2022/index.html` already exists.

Because ssg-go gives preferences to HTML files with matching base names,
and because the generator respects this behavior, the source HTML will be
copied and new index not generated.

If we focus on the root marker. We see that it has 5 siblings, namely,
`foo.md`, `bar.md`, `2022`, `2023`, and `somedir`.

The generated index should have links to these 3 children.
If the destination is `dst`, then the generated index from this root marker
will be at `dst/index.html`, mirroring `src/_index.soyweb` location in `src`.

We can look up the special ssg files so that we can compare the output:

`src/_header.html`:

```html
<!-- My blog header! -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>{{from-tag}}</title>
</head>
<body>
```

`src/_footer.html`:

```html
<!-- My blog footer! -->
</body>
</html>
```

`src/_index.soyweb`:

```markdown
:ssg-title My blog!

# Welcome to my blog!

Below is the list of my articles!

```

`src/foo.md`:

```
# Foo article

Foo is better than fu
```

`src/bar.md`:

```
:ssg-title Bar article

# Barbarbarbar

Greeks called other peoples babarians because all they hear is barbarbar
```

`src/somedir/index.md`:

```markdown
:ssg-title SomeDir title

# Welcome to SomeDir!

This is some directory
```

Now, the generated index `dst/index.html` looks like this:

```html
<!-- My blog header! -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>My blog!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>
<p>Below is the list of my articles!</p>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="/2023/">2023</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/2022/">2022</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/bar.html">Bar article</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/foo.html">Foo article</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/somedir/">SomeDir title</a></p></li>
</ul>
<!-- My blog footer! -->
</body>
</html>
```

What about `src/2023/_index.soyweb` marker? If it's not empty,
then the output will be generated in a fashion similar
to the root marker example above.

But what if the marker `src/2023/_index.soyweb` is empty?
If so, then the default heading will be used, and the generated
`dst/2023/index.html` looks something like this:

```html
<!-- My blog header! -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>SomeDefaultSsgGoTitle</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Index of somedir</h1>
<ul>
  <li><p><a href="/hahaha/">BarTitle</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="/baz.html">BazTitle</a></p></li>
</ul>
<!-- My blog footer! -->
</body>
</html>
```
